# ant_cube
ant cube problem from akuna interview

say you have an ant on a cube

the ant is doing a random walk on the edges of the cube 

every time it gets to a vertex it can choose which of the three edges it wants to go on (it can go back the way it came) with equal probability (1/3)

starting at some vertex, what is the expected number of steps/edge lengths the ant will walk before it comes back to the same vertex?

analysis done in jupyter with simulation and in octave with row reduction

answer: 8 steps
